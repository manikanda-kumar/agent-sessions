# Agents Guidelines

## Build & Review Discipline
- Do not ask the user to “confirm” or “if it looks good” until the code compiles locally with zero build errors.
- After making changes that affect Swift sources or Xcode integration, validate by building the active scheme.
- If the project cannot be built in your environment, clearly state what prevented the build, and provide the exact file and line references you validated.

## Swift/macOS QA
- If test automation or QA scripts force macOS Appearance to Dark Mode, always restore macOS Appearance back to `System` at the end of the run.
- In Codex Desktop, Swift/Xcode build and test commands commonly need access to Xcode cache directories that are outside the workspace sandbox. For `xcodebuild`, SwiftPM, or XCTest runs, request approved Xcode access up front when the command is expected to touch DerivedData, ModuleCache, SourcePackages, simulator caches, or other Xcode-managed cache paths. If a first run fails only because sandboxing blocked one of those paths, rerun the exact same command with approved Xcode access and report it as a sandbox access retry, not as a code or test failure.
- Prefer narrow approved command prefixes for trusted repo-local Xcode workflows, such as the canonical AgentSessions build/test commands and `./scripts/xcode_test_stable.sh`. Do not use broad auto-approval rules for arbitrary Xcode-looking commands; if a command falls outside the trusted prefixes, request explicit approved Xcode access for that command.

## Instructions for Codex CLI



### Format
```
I'll make the following changes:
- File X: Add/modify Y because Z
- File A: Remove B because C

[Immediately proceed with code changes - user has ESC window during explanation]

- Edited file.swift...
```

### Flow Pattern
**Correct:** Explain what will be done → Code → Results

### Examples of What NOT to Do
❌ Don't: Start with "• Edited file.swift..." before explaining
❌ Don't: Ask "Should I proceed?" or wait for confirmation
❌ Don't: Begin analyzing/thinking without stating the plan upfront

### Examples of What TO Do
✅ Do: "I'll tighten probe detection by requiring Probe WD for /status sessions and limiting marker matching. This reduces false positives." [then immediately start coding]
✅ Do: State the approach clearly, then flow directly into implementation
✅ Do: Give user the ESC window by printing plan first, but maintain momentum

### Special Mode
When user says "plan mode++" - ONLY provide the plan and stop. Wait for explicit approval before coding.

This applies to ALL coding requests. The explanation is for transparency and ESC opportunity, not for breaking flow.

### Significant change gating (must build before presenting)
Treat a change as “significant” and always run a build locally before presenting results when any of the following are true:
- Added, moved, or renamed any Swift file (app or tests).
- Modified more than ~40 lines of Swift across the app, or touched 2+ top‑level areas (e.g., Views + Services, Model + Views).
- Introduced or changed concurrency boundaries (actors, Task, async/await), or cross‑module interactions.
- Altered window/layout/toolbar structure or target membership (PBXBuildFile/target Sources).
- Changed build settings, target configuration, Info.plist, or added resources.

It is acceptable to present without building for clearly minor edits, for example:
- One‑line fixes that do not affect types/signatures, string/label copy changes, comment/doc updates, or pure Markdown/JSON assets.
- In case of doubt, prefer to build.

Suggested build steps
- Xcode: Product → Build (active scheme).
- CLI: `xcodebuild -project AgentSessions.xcodeproj -scheme AgentSessions -configuration Debug build` (or use your configured build task).

### Stable XCTest Invocation (avoid intermittent macOS code-sign flakes)
- Prefer the stable test wrapper: `./scripts/xcode_test_stable.sh`.
- Equivalent direct command:
  - `xcodebuild -project AgentSessions.xcodeproj -scheme AgentSessions -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' -derivedDataPath "$PWD/.deriveddata-tests" -parallel-testing-enabled NO clean test`
- Rationale: isolates test artifacts/signing state from shared `DerivedData`, which avoids intermittent `AgentSessionsTests.xctest` nested-signature failures.

## Terminal CLI (`tools/agent-sessions`)

Repo-local helper to list sessions for the **current git repository**, matching the macOS app: per-agent disk scans (all supported sources) merged with `~/Library/Application Support/AgentSessions/index.db` (`session_meta`, mainly Codex/Claude today).

Install once:

```bash
ln -sf "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/tools/agent-sessions" ~/.local/bin/agent-sessions
```

Usage (from any repo directory):

```bash
agent-sessions sources          # global index counts; DATA vs CLI columns
agent-sessions agents           # per-agent counts for this project
agent-sessions list             # all agents
agent-sessions list opencode    # filter by agent
agent-sessions list --resume      # include resume command hints
```

Tests: `python3 tools/test_agent_sessions_cli.py`

## Conventional Commits and Trailers
- Use Conventional Commits for every commit (feat, fix, docs, chore, etc.).
- Include trailers in the commit body:
  - `Tool: Cursor|Codex|Xcode|Manual|Claude|Figma`
  - `Model: <model-id>`
  - `Why: <1 line if behavior/structure changed>`

## User‑Visible Changes
- If you change user‑visible behavior or UI, add:
  - A bullet under `[Unreleased]` in `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
  - A 1–2 bullet note in `docs/summaries/YYYY-MM.md`.

## Documentation Style
- **Never use emoji** in user-facing documentation, including:
  - README.md
  - GitHub release notes
  - CHANGELOG.md
  - Other user-facing documentation
- Use clear, concise language without emoji decoration.

## Investigation and Findings Policy
- All findings in audits, plans, and reports must be **evidence-backed** — include file paths, line numbers, or exact output that substantiates each claim.
- Uncertainty must be **explicitly labeled as hypothesis** (e.g., "Hypothesis: X may cause Y because Z"), never presented as verified fact.
- Avoid probabilistic wording ("likely", "probably", "seems to") for claims that have been verified — use definitive language for verified facts and hypothesis labels for unverified ones.

## Xcode Project Hygiene
- When adding/moving/renaming Swift files (app or tests), ensure they are added to `AgentSessions.xcodeproj` with both a `PBXFileReference` and a `PBXBuildFile` in the correct target. Missing entries will break builds with "Cannot find … in scope".

## Adding New Swift Files to Xcode Project
When creating new Swift files, use the tested Ruby script to add them to the Xcode project:


**Script Location**
`scripts/xcode_add_file.rb` - Adds a Swift file to a target with proper PBXFileReference and PBXBuildFile entries.

**Usage Examples**

Add file to main app target under GitInspector group:
```bash
./scripts/xcode_add_file.rb AgentSessions.xcodeproj AgentSessions \
  AgentSessions/GitInspector/Models/InspectorKeys.swift \
  AgentSessions/GitInspector/Models
```

Add file to test target:
```bash
./scripts/xcode_add_file.rb AgentSessions.xcodeproj AgentSessionsTests \
  AgentSessionsTests/GitInspectorViewModelTests.swift \
  AgentSessionsTests
```

Add multiple files:
```bash
./scripts/xcode_add_file.rb AgentSessions.xcodeproj AgentSessions \
  AgentSessions/GitInspector/Utilities/ColorExtensions.swift \
  AgentSessions/GitInspector/Utilities

./scripts/xcode_add_file.rb AgentSessions.xcodeproj AgentSessions \
  AgentSessions/GitInspector/Views/StatusHeroSection.swift \
  AgentSessions/GitInspector/Views
```

**Verification**
Always build after adding files to verify they're properly integrated:
```bash
xcodebuild -project AgentSessions.xcodeproj -scheme AgentSessions \
  -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS' build
```

**CRITICAL: After ANY modification to project.pbxproj**
If you modify `AgentSessions.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` directly (NOT using the Ruby script):
1. **ALWAYS** resolve package dependencies first:
   ```bash
   xcodebuild -resolvePackageDependencies -project AgentSessions.xcodeproj -scheme AgentSessions
   ```
2. **THEN** verify the build succeeds:
   ```bash
   xcodebuild -project AgentSessions.xcodeproj -scheme AgentSessions -configuration Debug build
   ```
3. If package resolution fails or reports "Missing package product", the project.pbxproj was corrupted. Restore from git and use the Ruby script instead.

## UI/UX Rules (HIG‑Aligned)
- If content may exceed the window height, place the main content in a vertical `ScrollView` and keep footer/action controls outside the scroll region so actions remain visible.
- Use the shared spacing tokens and dynamic system colors. Avoid ad‑hoc paddings; prefer consistent section spacing and card padding.
- For subtle SwiftUI/AppKit visual changes, first identify the actual rendering layer that paints the visible UI. Do not assume a nearby palette, token, or model value is authoritative. Trace modifiers, custom `NSViewRepresentable` views, layout managers, drawing overrides, cached attributed strings, and alternate render modes as needed; patch the layer that actually draws the pixels, then verify the diff touches that layer.

## Safety & Execution
- Avoid shelling out when a safe `Process` + argument list is possible. Use timeouts and clear, inline error messages for failures.
- Never run network operations without an explicit user action and clear UX affordances.

## Feature Flags Policy
- Do not add feature flags, rollout flags, kill switches, or behavior gates unless the user explicitly asks for feature flags in the current request.
- When uncertain, implement the behavior directly without flags and call out any risks in the summary.

### Remote Doc/Header Fetch Guardrails
- For remote documentation, header, or API inspection tasks, delegate the fetch to a sub-agent first so the main agent remains responsive.
- Use a hard timeout of 20 seconds per delegated fetch attempt.
- If no useful output is returned within 20 seconds, cancel the attempt and immediately switch to a fallback source.
- Fallback order is: local repository docs/files, then a narrower targeted remote source.
- Do not run repeated unbounded retries; after fallback failure, report the limitation promptly and continue with best-effort local reasoning.


## Pattern Search & Deletion Safety (General)

When you search logs, filenames, or code and when you build scripts that might rename/move/delete files, follow these rules. They exist to prevent over‑matching (regex accidents) and accidental data loss.

### Search rules (use literals by default)
- Prefer ripgrep (`rg`) with fixed‑string mode for markers/tokens:
  - `rg -nF "[MY_MARKER v1]" path -g '**/*.jsonl'`
- If you must use regex: escape or anchor and include a quick test.
  - Brackets `[]`, `()`, `.`, `+`, `?`, `|`, `^`, `$` are metacharacters.
  - For JSON keys, match with quotes and minimal context: `rg -n '"key"\s*:\s*"value"'`.
- Always quote variables to prevent globbing and word‑splitting in shell:
  - `grep -F -- "$needle" "$file"` (not `grep $needle $file`).
- Scope searches with globs and roots; never scan `$HOME` blindly:
  - `rg -nF "$MARK" "$ROOT" -g '**/*.jsonl'`.
- Verify with a small sample before proceeding:
  - `rg -nF "$MARK" | head -n 20` and open a couple of files.

### Counting and classification
- Produce a brief “confusion matrix” for any non‑trivial match set:
  - Count by reason (e.g., `marker_only`, `path_only`, `both`).
  - Show 3 sample paths per bucket.
- Save manifests for later review (plain text or JSONL).

### Deletion / purge rules (must follow all)
1) Dry‑run by default
   - Every destructive script starts in dry‑run and prints counts, sample paths, and the exact command it would run.

2) Two‑signal match for deletion
   - Require at least two independent signals (e.g., marker AND working directory) before deleting. A single grep hit is insufficient.

3) Typed confirmation with exact count
   - To proceed, user must pass `--execute` and type a confirmation string that includes the count (e.g., `delete 22 files`).

4) Random sample preview for large sets
   - If deleting >20 items, print a random sample of 20 with the fields that justify deletion (e.g., first user line, cwd) before confirmation.

5) Narrow scope and guard rails
   - Restrict deletes to an explicit root; refuse to run on `/`, `$HOME`, or a missing/empty `$ROOT`.
   - Use `find ... -print0 | xargs -0` to handle spaces/newlines safely.
   - Never run `rm -rf` on interpolated paths without printing and pausing first.

6) Logging and rollback aids
   - Save a timestamped manifest of everything scheduled for deletion (and a copy of stdout) to `scripts/probe_scan_output/` or a similar audit folder.
   - Prefer moving to a quarantine folder first (with timestamp) when feasible; hard‑delete only after a second confirmation.

7) Tests / fixtures (for repo scripts)
   - Add positive and negative fixtures that prove the matcher is literal when required (e.g., markers with `[]`).
   - In CI, fail if expanding the pattern increases matches against the fixture corpus unexpectedly.

### Quick shell snippets (safe patterns)
- Literal marker search in JSONL:
  - `rg -nF "[AS_MARKER v1]" "$ROOT" -g '**/*.jsonl' | cut -d: -f1 | sort -u`
- JSON key/value search (escaped quotes):
  - `rg -n '"(cwd|project)"\s*:\s*".*MyProbeDir' "$ROOT" -g '**/*.jsonl'`
- Null‑safe deletion (dry‑run):
  - `find "$ROOT" -type f -name '*.jsonl' -print0 | xargs -0 -n100 echo rm -v` (prints planned deletes)
